This addon includes a 4k texture and bump-map for Jupiter, as seen from Hubble in 2015. 
Jupiters Atmosphere is now rendered through Celestia's scattering properties.

Jupiter has an ever-changing atmosphere. 
Belts and zones are forming and disappearing, the Great Red Spot is shrinking and other spots are forming. 
The best global map of Jupiter was made from Cassini data aquired in 2000, but only in red and blue filters, the green channel was syntethiced through mixing.
The colors are close to real colors, but not quite. 
The Hubble Space Telescope is observing Jupiter regulary in all wavelenghts. 
In 2015 Hubble aquired images of the giant planet which were processed into the second-best global map of Jupiter so far. 
NASA has not stated if the images were taken in red, blue AND green channels, but the map appears more colorful, so I assume this map is in true colors. 
Enjoy Jupiter in natural colors and high resolution!

I used the map NASA published on the photojournal:
	http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA19643
and merged it to the Cassini map:
	http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07782
to fill the gaps. I left the colors untouched, because they seem very realistic to me. 
I only made small adjustments like artifact removal and sharpening.
For a better appearence I produced a bump-map, which is roughly a b&w-copy, but processed to look best. 
It works surprisingly good with gas giants compared to solid bodys (apparently because of sharp shadows in the case of solid worlds).
Finally I reworked Jupiters atmosphere properties, it is now rendered via scattering. Spacecraft imaged show a bluish haze around the planet, I tried to imitate this.

Installation:	Just extract the zip-file into your Celestia/extras directory.
		The texture is avaliable as alternate surface, so select "Jupiter Hubble 2015" by right-clicking on Jupiter to show.
